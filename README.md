# My Coding Practice Journey
This repository contains my coding practice code as I learn programming from scratch. I’m focusing on mastering core programming concepts like variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, error handling, and more.

You’ll find a variety of coding exercises and practice code that reflect my progress, problem-solving skills, and creativity as I continue my coding journey.

I’m excited to share my practice code as I grow as a developer!
